Hello, this is the change log to uh describe details.


Current date: 5/18/2022

    Changed speeds 0-20 for People.java. (Set to a random speed between 0->5)
    'Entity.Java had it's hitbox creator +2' on all sides so it isn't so cut into the pictures when the collide. (Removed)
    In Game.java actually checked if people obj collided with player obj.
    In Game.java when you press escape it freezes the game and shows hitboxes. (Swapped it for press esc to see skins)
    In CollsionDetect.java fixed a problem where the hitboxes were only being updated to their original positions
        when they collide. (Still having a problem with hitboxes overlapping and freezing both characters)

    Kind of need a timer to fix the problem that people.java is moving too much, thus colliding to far into the player  
        and getting stuck. (Fixed)
    
    Only added InvisWalls.java and initalized the invisible walls on the play screen as "up, down, left, right"

    To make it less annoying, I make it so People.java only changes directions after 5 frames.

    Game.java
        -Finally understood why my ArrayList idea wasn't working. So I added some ArrayLists
        
    InvisWalls.java
        -Added a static ArrayList

    People.java
        -Same as above


Current date: 5/23/2022

    (New)Game.java
        -I added a frameCount and a seconds, where it will be used as a score (how long you survived) and as a 
        cooldown system for abilities and movements, so its not 1 movement every frame for the enemy.

        -Changed InvisWalls bounds because I need the player to not move, but the keyinputs would move all other entities.

        -Set player's starting location to center of screen?

    (New)People.java
        -Changed count method to determine direction and changed it to Game.frameCount

    (Notes)PlayerData, People, Game
        -You have to make the player NOT move but instead move the entities.
