Hello, this is the change log to uh describe details.



Bugs that need to be fixed:
    !!!!!!When any entity that has a stop movement collides corner to corner they are permanently stuck and areunable to move in that direction, or in some cases not able to move at all.

    (FIXED ABOVE) What the problem was is that player movements were unqiue because they could move in 8 directions compared to the CollsionDetect's method which checks 4.
    So I fixed it by making a player specifc detect, checking what keys are currently being pressed. Meaning it can check up+right at the same time instead of two instances of
    up then right, which might cause a perma collision.

    What causes this issue is if direction/movement is being chaged too fast, which happened when I set People.java's drection to be changed every frame.
    Also because of the nature of player the same thing happned above. So if you want to make a thing move really sparatically you need to make a unquie method and use the same
    idea behind the player check in CollsionDetect.java.

    !!!! When you spam two directions and are colliding with a wall, the wall moves.

    (NOTICE) Not as important as it is only the player that influences something, like that and it doesn't happen to much.


Things to add:
    -Fix the calculations for center of screen, when constucting the player's location.

    -Why do we need to have a collisiondection thing for the InvisWall, and how did that fix the problem of Entities intersecting??

    -Entity AI, where they move towards the player.

    -Projectiles.java

    -I guess we remake or add onto the entity class, with a string displaying the type of entity it is because we need to have dmg
    for player vs enemies and player vs projectiles and enemies vs player projectiles. Currently we have no idea else than
    "yes this entity is colliding with this entity".

    -Item.class which will be extending Entity.java, also with that we'll have another collision detect method I guess.

    -Add display of the time currently on the top center of the screen.

    -Title and end screen.

    -When you die, it takes that time and puts it into a txt file or a json file and thats the leaderbaord I guess.


Current date: 5/18/2022

    Changed speeds 0-20 for People.java. (Set to a random speed between 0->5)
    'Entity.Java had it's hitbox creator +2' on all sides so it isn't so cut into the pictures when the collide. (Removed)
    In Game.java actually checked if people obj collided with player obj.
    In Game.java when you press escape it freezes the game and shows hitboxes. (Swapped it for press esc to see skins)
    In CollsionDetect.java fixed a problem where the hitboxes were only being updated to their original positions
        when they collide. (Still having a problem with hitboxes overlapping and freezing both characters)

    Kind of need a timer to fix the problem that people.java is moving too much, thus colliding to far into the player  
        and getting stuck. (Fixed)
    
    Only added InvisWalls.java and initalized the invisible walls on the play screen as "up, down, left, right"

    To make it less annoying, I make it so People.java only changes directions after 5 frames.


Current date: 5/19/2022

    Game.java
        -Finally understood why my ArrayList idea wasn't working. So I added some ArrayLists.
        
    InvisWalls.java
        -Added a static ArrayList

    People.java
        -Same as above


Current date: 5/23/2022

    (New/Changed)Game.java
        -I added a frameCount and a seconds, where it will be used as a score (how long you survived) and as a 
        cooldown system for abilities and movements, so its not 1 movement every frame for the enemy.

        -Changed InvisWalls bounds because I need the player to not move, but the keyinputs would move all other entities.

        -Set player's starting location to center of screen?

    (Changed)People.java
        -Changed count method to determine direction and changed it to Game.frameCount
    
    (Changed)PlayerData.java
        -Made it so when playerMove is used it now returns an int, the int being the speed of the player. If it collides
        with something the speed returned is 0, but the player speed is still 10 to not mess with the collisionDetect.

    (New) Entity.java
        -Added a playerInfluencedMovement Method, where depending on the collision status and the speed of the player it moves
        the inserted entity. This makes the player always be on the center of the screen I guess.
        -Added a type variable, that is this.type set in all other object classes.

    (Changed)InvisWall.java
        -Sort of updaed the x,y,sizex,sizey when constructing a InvisWall

    (Removed) KeyHandler.java
        -I removed he lastPressed due to the fact that I finally understand what keyreleased actually did and its pretty
        cool.

    (Notes)PlayerData, People, Game
        -You have to make the player NOT move but instead move the entities. (Done-ish)
