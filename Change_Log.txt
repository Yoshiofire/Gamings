Hello, this is the change log to uh describe details.


Current date: 5/18/2022

    Changed speeds 0-20 for People.java.
    'Entity.Java had it's hitbox creator +2' on all sides so it isn't so cut into the pictures when the collide.
    In Game.java actually checked if people obj collided with player obj.
    In Game.java when you press escape it freezes the game and shows hitboxes.
    In CollsionDetect.java fixed a problem where the hitboxes were only being updated to their original positions
        when they collide.

    Kind of need a timer to fix the problem that people.java is moving too much, thus colliding to far into the player  
        and getting stuck.
    
    Only added InvisWalls.java and initalized the invisible walls on the play screen as "up, down, left, right"
